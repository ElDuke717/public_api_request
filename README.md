Project Notes:

Welcome to Jay's Ice Cream!  It's time to get to know your fellow employees.  Fortunately, there's a directory that you can use!

This project is being submitted for an "Exceeds Expectations" Grade and the following has been added:

* The search feature has been enabled and will show employees whose names match the text string that has been put into the 
search input form/box.   The longer the string, the more specific it is.  If there are no matches, nothing will show.

* The previous and next buttons will allow the user to scroll between employees in the directory in the modal window.  The user can freely scroll through the list, even when they reach the end or the beginning.

* Several styling changes have been made to the directory, including addition of a background pattern, addition of favorite ice cream flavors for each employee, random sweet treat emojis next to each employee's name that changes each time the page is refreshed, new added fonts and several other styling changes.

* Please note that since Jay's Ice Cream is an international company, some of the phone numbers and addresses will be formatted differently from how they are in the US. Also, due to legal constraints, Jay's is not allowed to publish employee's year of birth, only the month and date.
